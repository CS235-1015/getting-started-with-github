# getting-started-with-github
Github is a very simple program to use and will be very important to learn for future Jobs, that will most likly be using a program like git to keep everything in order. 

I suggest learning a little about git before class next week, here are some good resources:

The Client
=======
Git is mainly a commandline based program but luckly for us, Github has developed a desktop client that can be used for source control.

I suggest downloading a git GUI program because it will make things easier to work with.

There are other options for git GUI programs such as gitkraken, which has a wider option of functions but is also harder to use.

#Some things to remember:

becase we are all going to be working on the same project is is important that we always **Work out of seprate branches, NEVER WORK OUT OF THE MASTER BRANCH** 

Before you start to code make sure that you pull from origin and when you are done always commit your changes.
